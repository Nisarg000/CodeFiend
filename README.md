# CodeFiend
Me and my team we have created a working model of a robotic arm which detects objects and places it in it's designated areas.

In order to open our file you will have to use an Arduino IDE.
You can download the software from this link : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Open the .ino file in the arduino IDE and in order to execute our program you will have to attach the arduino board along with it.Make sure you attach the wires with respect to their designated slots.
