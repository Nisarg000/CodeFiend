# CodeFiend
Me and my team we have created a working model of a robotic arm which detects objects and places it in it's designated areas.

In order to open our file you will have to use an Arduino IDE.
You can download the software from this link : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Open the .ino file in the arduino IDE and in order to execute our program you will have to attach the arduino board along with it.Make sure you attach the wires with respect to their designated slots.

Just click on the 'Verify' and 'Upload' button to execute our program


Project Abstract :

Today, technology is developing in the same direction in line with rapidly increasing human needs. The work done to meet these needs makes life easier every day. Robot arms work with an outside user or by performing predetermined commands.

One of the main problems, that we face today is that we are still majorly dependent on the laborers or daily workers to do the heavy lifting manually. This always puts them at a high risk of injury. With our project, we can automate this tedious task.

In this project, we will have many predetermined drop positions and a specific pick-up location. The arm will pick the object available at the pickup spot and place it at any of the available aforementioned drop location.


Components
Arduino Uno
Acrylic Sticks and boards
Servo Motor
Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)
Bread Board
Jumper Wires
Bolts and screws 
10k resistor

Working
With this project, we’re trying to automate the transportation system which is practiced in industrial warehouses. 
At the base of our project, we have added a pick location and three predetermined drop spots. All the drop spots and the pickup location have an LDR attached to them which detects the presence of an object. If the arm detects an object on the pick-up location, it checks the availability at all the drop location. If none of the drop locations are free, the arm wouldn’t move. Else, it will pick up the object from the pick up spot and drop it on any of the available drop locations.

Applications and Advantages
This arm can be used in any of the industrial warehouses where internal transportation of goods takes place

Cost Effective 
It reduces the cost of human labour and very easy to maintain

Reduces the risk of workplace injuries 
The daily wage workers are usually tasked with the job of heavy lifting and transporting goods within the warehouse. These tasks make them prone to some workplace injuries. By automating the system reduces the risk of those injuries.

Optimized and Efficient
There is bound to be some human error in the manual system. With everything automated, there would be zero chance of human error and everything would run at a faster and smoother pace
